# Quantities

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jdreaver/quantities.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jdreaver/quantities)

Unit conversion and manipulation library for Haskell.

## TODO

* Check for correct dimensionality when converting, and make conversion
  computations monadic so this is easier.
* When reading definitions, make sure unit not already defined.
* More error checking for definitions (exhaustive pattern matching)
