# Quantities

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jdreaver/quantities.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jdreaver/quantities)

Unit conversion and manipulation library for Haskell.

## TODO

* Add ability to create units out of order; base quantity does not
  already have to be defined, as long as it is defined in the file.
* Add line numbers to definition parser
* Check that synonyms aren't already defined too
* Handle temperature!
